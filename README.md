# Troxal Extension
This is the official repository for the Troxal chrome extension.

# What is Troxal
Troxal is a suite of monitoring tools, developed to be deployed on chrome based devices to allow for website monitoring and blocking, as well as monitoring downloads, extensions, and bookmarks.

Technically, Troxal is compatiable with other browsers that support MV3, but results vary if not using Google Chrome. Firefox is incompatiable since Firefox doesn't have managed accounts. Edge is technically supported given Office365 management.
